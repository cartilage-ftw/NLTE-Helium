This folder contains the code for examining the viability of a NLTE He I 1083.3 nm line producing the observed optically thick 1 micron P Cygni feature in the kilonova AT2017gfo. 
It details a full collisional-radiative model of helium, which is deliberated in the paper "..." - and which is a further development of the model presented in Tarumi et al (2023), "Non-LTE analysis for Helium and Strontium lines in the kilonova AT2017gfo".
